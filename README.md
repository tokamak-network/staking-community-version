1. Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install and restart your computer
3. Start Docker Desktop (it will appear in your menu bar)

**Linux Users:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

**Step 2: Verify Docker Installation**
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and run:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

**Step 3: Download and Run the App**
1. **Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)**
2. **Navigate to where you want to install the app:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop
   
   # Mac/Linux
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```
3. **Download the app:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tokamak-network/staking-community-version.git
   cd staking-community-version
   ```
4. **Run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:18 npm install
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:18 npm run dev
   ```

**Note for Windows Users:** Replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%` in the commands above.

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. -->

## How to Use the App

This guide will walk you through using the staking app step by step, with visual examples.

---

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
![Login Screen](src/assets/images/docs/0-login.png)

1. **Click "Connect Wallet" button** on the main screen
2. **Choose MetaMask** (recommended for beginners)
3. **Approve the connection** in your wallet popup
4. **Switch to the right network** if prompted (Ethereum Mainnet or Sepolia Testnet)

---

### Step 2: Main Dashboard
![Main Dashboard](src/assets/images/docs/1-main.png)

After connecting your wallet, you'll see the main staking dashboard showing:
- **Your wallet address** and connection status
- **Total staked amount** in the staking service
- **Current staking APY** 
- **List of available operators** to stake with

**Understanding the Dashboard:**
- **L2 tags** appear for operators that are L2 Sequencers
- **Total Staked** shows the amount staked to that specific operator
- **"Your Staked"** displays the amount you have staked to that operator
- **Click on a specific operator** to view detailed information

---

### Step 3: Viewing Operator Details
![L2 Operator Details](src/assets/images/docs/2-L2operator.png)

On this screen, you can view the following information:
- **Total amount staked** to that operator
- **Commission rate** set by the operator
- **Your staked amount** to that operator
- **TON rewards** you can receive through Update Seigniorage
- **Last block number** when seigniorage was updated

**Claiming Rewards:**
- Click **Update Seigniorage** to claim unclaimed staking rewards
- **Confirm transaction** in your wallet

If the operator is an L2 Sequencer, you'll also see:
- **TON amount bridged** to that L2 network
- **TON amount** the L2 sequencer can claim

---

### Step 4: Input Staking Amount
![Input Amount](src/assets/images/docs/3-input_amount.png)

**How Staking Works:**
- You can stake using **TON or WTON tokens** you own
- When **TON is selected**, the Balance shows your available TON amount
- When **WTON is selected**, the Balance shows your available WTON amount
- Click the **Max button** to input the maximum amount you can stake (e.g., 121,955.25 TON as shown in the image)

**Confirming Your Stake:**
- After entering the amount, if everything is correct, the button changes to **"Stake"**
- Click the **Stake button** to execute the staking transaction

---

### Step 5: Managing Your Stakes

#### Unstake Your Stakes
![Unstake](src/assets/images/docs/8-unstake.png)

**What is Unstake:**
- **Unstake** is the process to withdraw L1 staked amounts
- **Do NOT use Unstake** if you want to withdraw to L2 - use Withdraw-L2 instead
- **Maximum amount** you can input in Unstake is limited to your "Your Staked Amount"

**How to Unstake:**
1. Click the **Unstake button** on your staking position
2. **Enter the amount** you want to unstake
3. **Confirm the transaction** in your wallet 

#### Withdrawing Your Stakes

##### Option 1: L1 Withdrawal (Standard)
![L1 Withdrawal](src/assets/images/docs/4-select l1 withdraw.png)

1. **Click the withdraw button** on your staking position
2. **Select L1 withdrawal** for standard Ethereum network
3. **Choose token** to withdraw - select TON to receive TON, select WTON to receive WTON
4. **Available withdrawal amount** is automatically calculated and filled in
5. **Confirm transaction** in your wallet

##### Option 2: L2 Withdrawal (If Available)
![L2 Withdrawal](src/assets/images/docs/5-select l2 withdraw.png)

**What is L2 Withdrawal:**
L2 Withdrawal allows you to withdraw TON staked to an L2 network (e.g., Poseidon in the image above) where your operator acts as a sequencer. While L1 Withdrawals take about 2 weeks, L2 Withdrawals only require waiting for the L2 network to process the deposited amount.

**How to Withdraw to L2:**
1. **Select L2 withdrawal** if your operator supports it
2. **Choose withdrawal amount**
3. **Confirm the transaction**
4. **Wait for L2 processing** before funds are available


#### Restake Your Stakes
![Restake](src/assets/images/docs/9-restake.png)

**What is Restake:**
Restake is a feature that allows you to change your mind and stake again before the Withdrawal Delay period ends after unstaking. **Important:** The entire unstaking amount will be restaked, so use this feature carefully.

**How to Restake:**
1. **Check the pending amount** after unstaking
2. **Click Restake** to confirm
3. **Confirm the transaction** in your wallet
